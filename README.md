# fduquea's Coding Journey 👨‍💻

## Hi there! 👋

### I'm fduquea, and welcome to my coding journey! 🚀

🏫 I'm studying at [42porto](https://www.42porto.com/).

🔨 Currently, I'm working on the ['so_long'](https://github.com/fduquea/42_so_long) project, which is a 2D game developed using the 42 minilibx library.

📚 I'm currently learning and exploring various programming concepts. My progress in the course I'm doing can be found in my [42_cursus repository](https://github.com/fduquea/42_cursus).

🌟 Trying to improve my coding skills every day!
