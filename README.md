Hi there! 👋

I'm fduquea, welcome to my coding journey!

I'm studying at [42porto](https://www.42porto.com/).

Currently, I'm working on the ['so_long'](https://github.com/fduquea/42_so_long) project, which is a 2D game developed using the 42 minilibx library.

You can reach me at filipe.duke.azevedo@gmail.com.

I'm currently learning and exploring various programming concepts. My progress in the course I'm doing can be found in my [42_cursus repository](https://github.com/fduquea/42_cursus).

Trying to improve my coding skills every day.
